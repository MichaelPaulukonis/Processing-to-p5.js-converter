# Processing-to-p5.js-converter

This is handy for quick conversions, if imperfect.
It relies on regex replacements - which is problematic.
But quick-n-easy.

## Notes

Remove type (or "var" conversion) from signatures

```java
void brush2(float x,float y, float px, float py, float lineWidth) {
  // ...
}
```

# Roadmap

- Unit-tests
- Linting, etc.
- publish to github.io
- Or not. Who knows!
